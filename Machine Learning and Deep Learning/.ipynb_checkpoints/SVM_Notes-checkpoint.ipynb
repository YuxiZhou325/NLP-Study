    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is a set of **supervised learning** methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.\n",
    "It is a **Binary Classification** model, it reflects the instances into dots in the space, and aims to draw a line to distinguish these dots in a best way,\n",
    "so that when there comes new dots, the line can classify them.\n",
    "<span style=\"color:orange\">SVMs are suitable for mid-little level data samples, non-linear, high dimension problems.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature vectors of the instances are mapped to some points in the space (take 2d as example).\n",
    "The purpose of SVM is to draw a line to distinguish the two types of points in the best way,\n",
    "so that if there are new points in the future, this line can also make a good classification.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: How many lines can be drawn to distinguish the sample points?\n",
    "> There are countless lines that can be drawn. The difference is whether the effect is good or not.\n",
    "> Each line can be called a dividing hyperplane.\n",
    "> For example, the green line above is not good, the blue line is OK, and the red line looks better. The best line we hope to find is the \"division hyperplane with the largest interval\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Why do we call it Hyper-plane?\n",
    "> Because the sample features might be very possibly high dimension, therefore, it won't be a single line to distinguish them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: What is the criteria of this line?\n",
    "> The SVM will look for the partitioning hyperplane that can distinguish between the two categories and **maximize the margin**.\n",
    "> It is better to divide the hyperplane, the impact on it is the smallest when the sample is locally disturbed,\n",
    "> the classification result is the most robust, and the generalization ability to unseen examples is the strongest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: What is Margin\n",
    "> For any hyperplane, the data points on both sides of it have a **minimum distance (vertical distance)** from it,\n",
    "> and the sum of these two minimum distances is the interval.\n",
    "> For example, the band-shaped area formed by the two dotted lines in the figure below is margin,\n",
    "> and the dotted line is determined by the two points closest to the central solid line (that is, determined by the support vector).\n",
    "> But at this time, the margin is relatively small. If we use the second method to draw, the margin will be significantly larger and closer to our goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "![svm_02](images/svm_02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Why make the margin as large as possible?\n",
    "> Because it is less bias when the margin is large, which is robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: What is Support Vector?\n",
    "> As can be seen from the figure above, the distance between the points on the dotted line and the dividing hyperplane is the same.\n",
    "> In fact, only these points jointly determine the position of the hyperplane, so they are called \"support vectors\".\n",
    "> \"Support vector machine\" also came from this.\n",
